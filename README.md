# agent-base

A Rust-based agent for interacting with the Gemini API.

## Overview

This project is a Rust-based agent that leverages the Gemini API to perform various tasks. It's designed as a command-line application, allowing users to specify tasks and interact with the Gemini API. The agent handles configuration and interacts with the Gemini API.

## Functionality

The agent's primary functionality is to execute tasks using the Gemini API. The specific tasks that can be performed depend on the implementation. The application takes a task as an argument, and then executes it using the agent.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Rust toolchain (including Cargo)
*   A Gemini API key

### Installation

To build the project, you will need to clone the repository and build it using Cargo. Please refer to the Cargo documentation for detailed instructions.

### Configuration

The agent requires a Gemini API key to be configured. This can be done through environment variables or a configuration file. Please refer to the project's documentation or help message for specific configuration options.

### Usage

The agent is a command-line application. To run it, use the command-line interface, providing the task as an argument. Use the `--help` flag for usage instructions.
